This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier\nCVE-2022-30122.\n\nVersions Affected:  >= 1.2\nNot affected:       < 1.2\nFixed Versions:     2.0.9.1, 2.1.4.1, 2.2.3.1\n\n## Impact\nCarefully crafted multipart POST requests can cause Rack's multipart parser to\ntake much longer than expected, leading to a possible denial of service\nvulnerability.\n\nImpacted code will use Rack's multipart parser to parse multipart posts.  This\nincludes directly using the multipart parser like this:\n\n```\nparams = Rack::Multipart.parse_multipart(env)\n```\n\nBut it also includes reading POST data from a Rack request object like this:\n\n```\np request.POST # read POST data\np request.params # reads both query params and POST data\n```\n\nAll users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the\nworkarounds immediately.\n\n## Workarounds\nThere are no feasible workarounds for this issue.\n",
